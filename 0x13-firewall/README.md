In this project we hsall be working with firewalls.
- Firewalls are cyber security tools that monitor incoming and outgoing network traffci and allow or prohibit data packets based on a set of cybersecurity rules. They are typically used to protect network nodes from agress and influx of data traffic, as well as specific applications.

- Firewalls protect networks from external attacks by utilizing software, hardware, or cloud-based methods. A firewall's primary goal is to block malicious traffic and data packets while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through.

- To prevent attacks, firewalls examine inbound traffic based on predefined security rules and filter traffic from unsecured or suspicious sources. Traffic is monitored at computer entry points known as ports, where information is exchanged with external devices.

- There are two types of firewalls based on what they protect: network-based and host-based.
	1. Network-based firewalls, which are frequently hardware, protect entire networks. 
	2. Host-based firewalls, which are frequently software, protect individual devices known as hosts.
